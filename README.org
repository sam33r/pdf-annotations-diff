#+TITLE: pdf-annotations-diff

I frequently need to compare my annotations on multiple versions of a PDF file. If you are amongst the three other people who need to do the same, this Python script would be useful to you.

This script compares annotations across two PDF files (which are assumed to be two versions of the same base PDF file). It outputs annotations that are unique to each of the two files.

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install pdf-annotations-diff
#+END_SRC

* Usage

To compare annotations in two PDF files, you can use the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pdf-annotations-diff file1.pdf file2.pdf
#+END_SRC

* Dependencies

This script depends on the [[https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/][PyMuPDF]] library.

* Example

This is an example of how to use pdf-annotations-diff to compare two PDF files:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pdf-annotations-diff Men\ Without\ Women\ -\ Haruki\ Murakami.pdf Men\ Without\ Women\ -\ Haruki\ Murakami.sync-conflict.pdf
#+END_SRC

And the resulting output would look something like this:
